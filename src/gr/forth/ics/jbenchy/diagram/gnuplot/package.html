        Provides support for generating <a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/">gnuplot</a>
        diagrams from reports generated by {@link gr.forth.ics.jbenchy.Aggregator}.
        
        <h2>Package Specification</h2>
        Class {@link gr.forth.ics.jbenchy.diagram.gnuplot.GnuPlotWriter} can
        be used to create files ready to be feed to gnuplot and generate
        postscript diagrams. A GnuPlotWriter instance writes one or many
        diagrams inside a specified folder. For each diagram, two files are needed:
        a data file, containing the raw data that gnuplot can read, tab-delimitted,
        and a command (.plt) file which contains gnuplot commands that
        instruct gnuplot to generate the diagram from a data file. In the end,
        a "master" plot file can be created (see
        {@link gr.forth.ics.jbenchy.diagram.gnuplot.GnuPlotWriter#createMasterPlotFile(String)}),
        which simply invokes all the previously created command files, so it is more
        convenient to pass this file for execution by gnuplot, and all diagrams are
        created in one step.
        <p>
        Gnuplot is quite complicated, and it is not practical to provide a full
        abstraction of it. Instead, the class {@link gr.forth.ics.jbenchy.diagram.gnuplot.GnuPlotContext}
        is provided, which offers additional customization capabilities in the process
        of diagram generation (or, more accurately, customization of the creation
        of the gnuplot command files). Also, it provides basic support for <i>styles</i>,
        that is, one can define a gnuplot style with which to depict a dataset. For example,
        {@link gr.forth.ics.jbenchy.diagram.gnuplot.PlotStyle#points()} can
        be used to create a scatter plot, whereas {@link gr.forth.ics.jbenchy.diagram.gnuplot.PlotStyle#lines()}
        connects data points with lines. See below for an example of this working.
        <p>
        An example of usage follows. Assume this preparation exists (which is explained in {@link gr.forth.ics.jbenchy.Aggregator}):
        <pre>
Aggregator aggregator = ...;
Records records = aggregator. ... report(...);
Diagram diagram = DiagramFactory.newDiagram(records)
    .withTitle("My Title")
    .withRangeLabel("Time (milliseconds)");
        </pre>
        <p>
        <strong>Important note:</strong> If a report is generated by two variables, then
        <i>at least the first must have number values; this is a gnuplot-specific restriction</i>.
        <p>
        Now, to create the gnuplot files for this diagram, instantiate a writer to a (relative to current directory) folder:
        <pre>
GnuPlotWriter writer = new GnuPlotWriter(new File("diagramsFolder"));
writer.writeDiagram(diagram, "myDiagram");
        </pre>
        This creates a data file and a gnuplot command file in <tt>diagramsFolder</tt> with names <tt>myDiagram1.*</tt>
        <p>
        We can customize the gnuplot commands by creating a GnuPlotContext:
        <pre>
GnuPlotContext context = new GnuPlotContext();
        </pre>
        There are various things that can be tweaked, like setting variables and style for columns. For example, this:
        <pre>
context.setLogscaleX();
context.setLogscaleY();
        </pre>
        will cause the additional gnuplot instructions to appear in the gnuplot command file:
        <pre>
set logscale x
set logscale y
        </pre>
        In order for this to happen, the diagram must be generated like this:
        <pre>
writer.writeDiagram(diagram, "myDiagram", context);
        </pre>
        
        Generally, <tt>context.set("var", "value")</tt> will cause <tt>set var value</tt> to appear in the gnuplot instructions,
        right before the plot. After that, the variable would be unset by <tt>unset var</tt>.
        <p>
        The default style for plotting is by connecting subsequent data points with lines, i.e. a simple lines chart. To create a scatter plot,
        i.e. a plot of plain XY points, try this:
        <pre>
int variableIndex = 1;
context.setStyle(variableIndex, PlotStyle.points());
        </pre>
        Plotting styles can also define a specific drawing pattern (like a cross, a star, a triangle, etc.), like this:
//Used to draw the first dataset
context.setStyle(1, PlotStyle.points(Pattern.STAR));
//Used to draw the second dataset
context.setStyle(2, PlotStyle.lines(Pattern.BOX_FILLED));
        <p>
        A default plotting style can also be defined, that takes effect for all datasets with undefined
        styles (which can be overriden with a specific style setting). For example:
        <pre>
context.setDefaultStyle(PlotStyle.points());
        </pre>
