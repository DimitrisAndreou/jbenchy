        JBenchy is a toolkit that aims at productivity in the areas of gathering experimental data and creating reports and diagrams of them.
        <p>
        Typically, an experiment has the purpose of understanding the connection of some variables in regards to some measurements. To this
        aim, variables repeatedly take various combinations of values and an outcome is experimentally measured. Data would be stored
        in custom structures, and then, in order to analyze the data (to answer questions like "how does this variable influences the outcome",
        which could be translated to "show me the average of the outcome for each distinct value of this variable"), custom code would
        be required. Maintaining the ad-hoc structures and code is not easy, especially while researching and constantly changing the
        parameters of the experiment, as well as the questions to be answered.
        <p>
        JBenchy greatly simplifies the process of gathering data (storing them in an underlying, zero-configuration database) and
        reporting them. See <a href="gr/forth/ics/jbenchy/package-summary.html">gr.forth.ics.jbenchy</a> for examples.
        Also, some support for automatically creating visual diagrams out of reports, see <a href="gr/forth/ics/jbenchy/diagram/package-summary.html">gr.forth.ics.jbenchy.diagram</a>,
        <a href="gr/forth/ics/jbenchy/diagram/gnuplot/package-summary.html">gr.forth.ics.jbenchy.diagram.gnuplot</a> and <a href="gr/forth/ics/jbenchy/diagram/jfreechart/package-summary.html">gr.forth.ics.jbenchy.diagram.jfreechart</a>.
